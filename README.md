# Object_detection
2D object detection

VGG Net, Res Net, Inception
Fast RCNN
SSD,YOLOv4


3D object detection can be done using 2D object detection+ Depth estimation using sterio vision

A very good resource to refer concepts of deep learning http://cs231n.stanford.edu/schedule.html


Object tracking is done using YOLO and DeepSort
